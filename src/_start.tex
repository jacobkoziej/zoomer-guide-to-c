\chapter{\texttt{\_start}}

It only feels right to \mintinline{c}{_start} with a few instructions to
get us ready for the \mintinline{c}{main()} matter of the book.  Jokes
aside, there are a few things that are important to touch upon before we
cover any material.  Much how \mintinline{c}{_start} prepares our
program before its call to \mintinline{c}{main()}, we must do the same
as the execution of the rest of this book depends on us soundly getting
off the ground!
