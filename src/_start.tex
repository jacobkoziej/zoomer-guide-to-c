\chapter{\texttt{\_start}}

It only feels right to \mintinline{c}{_start} with a few instructions to
get us ready for the \mintinline{c}{main()} matter of the book.  Jokes
aside, there are a few things that are important to touch upon before we
cover any material.  Much how \mintinline{c}{_start} prepares our
program before its call to \mintinline{c}{main()}, we must do the same
as the execution of the rest of this book depends on us soundly getting
off the ground!

\section{A Unix-Like Environment}

This book will be running under the assumption that you're working in a
Unix-like environment, more specifically, a Linux-based environment.
macOS users, you'll most likely be able to follow along for most of the
book, but beware, there are slight nuances between Linux and macOS!
Windows users, sorry, but you're out of luck here, though you may have
varied luck with the Windows Subsystem for Linux\footnote{\url{https://%
learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about}}.

If you are not already working in a Linux-based environment, I highly
recommend you get into one while going through this book, as it's the
most convenient to work with for C development.  Possible options
include, but are not limited to: a full Linux install, a dual-boot Linux
install, or a virtual machine installation (though the latter is rather
lackluster).

\section{The Right Editor}

Choosing the right editor is imperative if you are to benefit the most
from this book.  It is for this very reason I \emph{strongly} advise
against using \textbf{any} form of IDE.  The reason for this is simple:
they hide the steps required to get from source code to an executable
that your machine can run.  An IDE is fine for a seasoned C programmer;
but detrimental to someone just starting, as you'll have no idea how a
compilation error came to fruition. If you're struggling to find a good
editor, I recommend Neovim\footnote{\url{https://neovim.io/}}.

Another thing is autocompletion: it is the bane of all evil when you're
learning a language.  It's understandable if you wish to be fast, but
you're here to \emph{learn}, not press \key{Tab}!  Disable it if your
editor enables it by default.  You'll thank me later.

\section{Indentation}

Setting your editor's indents to 8 characters wide does two things: it
makes indents clear and makes it irritating to write deeply nested code.
The latter point is of particular importance.

Many editors allow you to add a colored column at a specified position.
I recommend adding one at 80 characters.  The number 80 originates from
when terminals were \(24 \times 80\) characters in size.  Once added,
don't allow your code to exceed this limit (within reason).

It may seem strange to intentionally constrain ourselves to what used to
be a technological limitation, but it serves a great purpose: it forces
us to write better code!  Once indentation exceeds a few levels, you'll
notice that it becomes exhausting to stay within the 80-character limit;
this is a telltale sign that it may be time to step back and restructure
your code.  Do this, and you'll avoid what I call nesting hell!
