\chapter{\texttt{\_start}}

It only feels right to \mintinline{c}{_start} with a few instructions to
get us ready for the \mintinline{c}{main()} matter of the book.  Jokes
aside, there are a few things that are important to touch upon before we
cover any material.  Much how \mintinline{c}{_start} prepares our
program before its call to \mintinline{c}{main()}, we must do the same
as the execution of the rest of this book depends on us soundly getting
off the ground!

\section{A Unix-Like Environment}

This book will be running under the assumption that you're working in a
Unix-like environment, more specifically, a Linux-based environment.
macOS users, you'll most likely be able to follow along for most of the
book, but beware, there are slight nuances between Linux and macOS!
Windows users, sorry, but you're out of luck here, though you may have
varied luck with the Windows Subsystem for Linux\footnote{\url{https://%
learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about}}.

If you are not already working in a Linux-based environment, I highly
recommend you get into one while going through this book, as it's the
most convenient to work with for C development.  Possible options
include, but are not limited to: a full Linux install, a dual-boot Linux
install, or a virtual machine installation (though the latter is rather
lackluster).
