\noindent
Fascinating, right?  What we're looking at here is Quake III's fast
inverse square root\footnote{\url{https://github.com/id-Software/%
Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/game/q_math.c\#L552}}, and it's
absolutely \emph{genius}.  When I think of C programming, this is the
first thing that comes to mind: pure cleverness and a deep understanding
of hardware features.  Of course, we still have a long way ahead of us
before you can truly appreciate the beauty of this code, but that's
alright.  After all, isn't that why you're here?
